This repository is a **test automation suite** built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/intro) to test the functionality, performance, and accessibility of websites. 
It serves as a learning playground (for myself too) for experimenting with Playwright's powerful features and a foundation for reusable testing scripts.
